defmodule Mix.Tasks.Mob.Flake do
  @shortdoc "Run the suite repeatedly to surface flaky tests"

  @moduledoc """
  Run the test suite until it fails, or a set number of times, and report
  which tests were not deterministic.

  A flake does not announce itself. It fails once, on someone else's branch,
  and the natural response is to re-run and move on — which is how a 1-in-17
  failure survived long enough to corrupt a mutation-testing verdict and send
  a bisect down the wrong path. This makes looking cheap and deliberate.

      mix mob.flake                    # 20 runs, stop at the first failure
      mix mob.flake --runs 50          # more attempts
      mix mob.flake --until-failure    # keep going until one fails
      mix mob.flake --keep-going       # run them all, report every failure
      mix mob.flake test/mob/nav       # narrow the target
      mix mob.flake --seed 0           # fix the seed, so ordering is constant

  ## Reading the result

  A test that fails under `--seed 0` on every run is not flaky, it is broken.
  This looks for the other kind: tests that pass and fail with everything else
  held still. Those are almost always a race — a `Process.sleep` standing in
  for synchronisation, a check-then-act across a process boundary, or shared
  global state (a named process, an ETS table) whose lifetime is tied to
  whichever test happened to start it.

  Narrowing helps more than volume. If a failure names one module, run that
  module 200 times rather than the suite 20 more times.
