defmodule Mob.ScreenRepaintTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A message that changes nothing must not cross to native.

  `forward/2` used to repaint after every `handle_info`, whether or not the
  message changed anything. That is one full render — clear_taps, a register_tap
  per interactive node, serialisation, set_root, native tree rebuild — per
  inbound message, so a 30 Hz scroll handler drove 30 of them a second. It also
  fed a feedback loop, because each render's clear_taps zeroes the per-handle
  native throttle state: MOB-134 measured 68 vs 69 events for a throttled and an
  unthrottled handler delivered to a screen, against 33 vs 5 for the same
  handlers delivered to a plain process.

  Counted at the NIF rather than inferred, so it keeps holding when the render
  path is rearranged.
